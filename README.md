# Popschools.org Website (WIP)

We are in the process of relaunching PopSchools and building the community and codebase in public. 

Eventually the popschools.org site will be an entry point to all things PopSchools. We are getting set up now to be able to accept code and content contributions.

Sign up and [join our community](https://circle.popschools.com) if you would like to participate in our projects.
